    <p>Dota has many hero types, the main difference being the main state they have.</p>
    <section id="strength">
      <p><b>Strength:</b>Strength heroes tend to have more health and health regeneration than other heroes, making them more resilient to both physical attacks and spells. Strength heroes have a great variety in their roles, including that of carry, ganker, and support, but almost all of them have some form of strong initiation and are supposed to act as tanks to some degree. In addition, heroes with a large amount of strength may greatly increase the damage needed to bring a team down. With a few exception, most strength heroes are melee. Whilst intelligence heroes typically sport a strong early game, and Agility heroes excel in the late game, Strength heroes are often able to strike a balance between the two and remain relevant at all points of the game.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="agility">
      <p><b>Agility:</b>Because Agility heroes are the only class of heroes to gain both damage and attack speed as their primary attribute increases, they tend to have the highest physical damage output as the game progresses. This makes them scale very well with offensive items. They tend to have limited disabling capabilities or nukes; almost all their abilities augment their physical capabilities or serve as positioning or escape mechanisms. This tends to make them much more vulnerable and weak in the early game when strong offensive disables and nukes dictate the flow of kills, but also means that, with good items under their belts, they will be the ones delivering the greatest amount of damage in the late game, while also being dealt the least amount of physical damage as a result of their high armor. Agility heroes have a roughly even split between being melee or being ranged, and fit primarily into carry and ganker roles.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="intelligence">
      <p><b>Intellegence:</b> Intelligence heroes tend to have a greater number of active abilities compared to other heroes; all intelligence heroes have at least three active abilities, with a large number of them having all four of their abilities being actives, and some even having 5 or more. Their larger mana pools and higher mana regen rates go a long way to help them use these abilities frequently. As a whole, intelligence heroes have by far the greatest number of disabling capabilities, making them essential in most lineups. The items they build also tend to be highly caster based, since those items primarily provide intelligence. With a few exceptions, most intelligence heroes are ranged. Most intelligence heroes rely on their spells for damage, but in most cases, these have static damage values only increased by spell damage amplification or damage manipulation. They do not scale well into the late game, so that most intelligence heroes peak during the early to mid game, where their spells deal the most damage in relation to enemy health pools and resistance, and then start to fall off in the late game. Because of this, they often fit into support and ganker roles. There are exceptions to this though, some intelligence heroes have scaling abilities which make them excellent in the late game.</p>
